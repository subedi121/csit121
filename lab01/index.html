    <h2>Brought to you by Chef Subedi</h2>
    
<p><b><u>Ingredients:</u></b></p>
<ul>
    <li>Rice</li>
    <li>Goat meat(100gm)</li>
    <li>Chicken(100gm)</li>
    <li>Shrimp(8-10 pcs)</li>
    <li>Biryani Masala</li>
    <li>Curd</li>
    <li>Cream</li>
    <li>Butter</li>
    <li>Ginger garlic paste</li>
    <li>mint leaves</li>
    <li>Rosewater</li>
</ul>

<p><b><u>Instructions:</u></b></p>
<ol>
    <li>We'll start off by soaking 1 kilogram of rice in  water for an hour. We will do that until it starts softening a bit. I like to add a touch of rosewater as well.</li>
    <li>While we wait on that, we start by chopping chicken and goat meat into a relatively larger piece that we do normally. </li>
    <li>Then, we start to marinate the meat. We take shrimp chicken and goat and mix it with biryani masala, ginger garlic paste, salt, butter, cumin seeds and other spices as per your preference.(Avoid adding cream during marination so it doesn't get too soggy.) </li>
    <li>After letting it marinate it for an hour or so, we start the main phase.</li>
    <li>Add around 100gm of butter in a pan and let it heat.(I would recommend a clay pot if available.) Add a little bit of ginger garlic paste and cumin seeds.Let it heat in high flame.</li>
    <li>Add all the meat once the pan and butter is heated nicely. Cook it on high flame for sometime and add cream. Once it starts getting a creamy yellowish texture, lower the flame and let it cook for another 5 minutes. </li>
    <li>Once everything is nice and cooked. We will take half the portion and keep in a separate bowl. We will use it to layer the biryani later.</li>
    <li>Now, add half portion of the soaked rice into the pan. Spread it nice and thick. Once it's done add a bit of rosewater and melted butter on top.</li>
    <li>We will then take the other half portion and add it into the rice layer. Add the other half meat similarly. Add a touch of rosewater and butter. Also, add chopped mint leaves and a spoonful of biryani masala on top and let it cook on small flame for another 5 minutes</li>
    <li>The biryani is ready to be served. Serve it with raita and chilly and onions. </li>
    <li>Enjoy the delicious biryani with your loved ones.</li>
</ol>

<p>The reason i like this recipe is because this prevent the biryani to be soggy and unnecessarily creamy. Unlike most biryani, this biryani has layers of rice and meat which is already very appealing. I like to add a touch of rosewater which is rare. I do this so the rice itself is flavorful.<br> <u><b>Remember, Biryani is supposed to be in layers.</b></u></p>
